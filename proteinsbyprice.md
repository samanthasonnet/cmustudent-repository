# Makeover Monday: The Cheapest Ways to Get Your Protein Right Now 
## Original Source & Visualization
Source: https://lifehacker.com/the-cheapest-ways-to-get-your-protein-right-now-1850001760  
For this assignment, I chose to use this dataset because I think this information is interesting as a student who is on a budget, but also enjoys eating healthy/working out and eating protein-rich foods. Because of this, I find this article to be very useful for someone coming from this type of standpoint, and given that the website source is "Life Hacker: Do Everything Better" I believe it has been placed in the right place for likely an optimal audience. It also may be served well if the information was placed in a health magazine as well. At first, I did not believe that there was a chart or visualization for this data, as it is all written down in an article-like format with a bulleted list of proteins and prices. However, upon talking with one of my peers from the class, I came to realize that there is in fact a chart associated with the data, but it is NOT from the same source and is contained in an entirely different link on the Makeover Monday website, therefore causing me to misunderstand. However, even though Makeover Monday has provided a link to a potential graph, it is important to note that the protein items listed in this chart are NOT the same items listed in the article, and for that reason I feel it is not applicable to the article anyways. Because of this, I completed this assignment under the assumption that there was no visualization associated with the dataset, which I find to be boring with little appeal. If designed properly, this information could be very useful for people who are operating on a budget but find value in their intake of specific proteins. I enjoy that they provided a vegetarian option to make it accessible for MOST but not all. If I were to change something, I would make sure to include a section that lays out protein options for those who are vegan. My google form that I submitted, concerning the effectiveness of the data visualization, was also completed on the assumption of there being no visualization. On a scale of 1 - 10, I made the following rankings: Usefulness (8), Completeness (4), Perceptability (4), Truthfulness (4), Intuitiveness (5), Aesthetics (1), and Engagement (7). I feel that the data in this article is completely useful and engaging for the intended audience, however the lack of a visualization results in a lack of completeness, perceptablility, intuitiveness, and aesthetics. I also believe that this information is not necessarily as truthful as it could be, due to the fact that this data supposedly represents the costs of protein in Pittsburgh and generally prices tend to be much higher than what is reflected here... in my personal opinion. It was for these reasons that I decided to draft a few sketches for a new visualization of the dataset, and asked for feedback from my peers concerning my design as well.

## Critiques from Peers
### Student, 23, female: 
#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
>"So I think this is trying to show the cost of protein options at the store (honestly kind of slay I needed this)."
#### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
>"What I’m seeing is that the vegan proteins are all around $1.25 or less per 20 grams, and on average, animal proteins are more expensive."
#### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
>"I’m surprised to see how expensive CANNED chicken is??? Thats shocking to me, and it’s also shocking to see how beans are more expensive than chicken breast and right around the price of eggs for the same amount of protein."
#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
>"I think the audience for this is people who are trying to save money or people trying to convince their friends to eat a plant based diet?" 
#### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
>"I think that I’d use your opportunity to redesign to really hone in on an audience (maybe vegans could be good), you could use grey for the meats to make the vegan and vegetarian options stand out! You don’t need to use the same graph title or anything (you could do something like 'Eating Plant-Based Helps Your Health and your Wallet'. You could even use like two shades of green (lighter for vegetarian and darker for vegan)"
### Student, 23, female:
#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
>"It looks like bar graphs displaying the differences of price of proteins for 2023."
#### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
>"This tells me that contrary to popular beliefs, vegan or vegetarian options of proteins seem to be cheaper per unit than 'traditional' sources like meat."
#### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
>"I’m surprised that canned chicken is the most expensive per unit and that the vegetarian and vegan options are cheaper."
#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
>"The intended audience could be those looking for a variety of proteins options for a more diverse diet, or those who are unable to get protein from meat."
#### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
>"I know it is labeled as the cheapest protein options, but it would be interesting to see how the 'fake meats' would compare, like black bean burgers/patties, impossible patties, etc., because black beans as a source shown in the graph are on the lower end. It would be interesting to see if and how much that would change after production into ✨patties✨"
