# Changes made since Part II
> The feedback from Part II helped me greatly to realize that I needed to bridge the gap between what I knew from my research (and forgot was not common knowledge) and what the intended audience knew. Because of this, I decided to create a storyboard from scratch on Shorthand that created a linear, impactful story. It was also my intention to explain WHY I felt it necessary to tell the story given my background not only as an arts manager, but also as a student who grew up in the Southwestern PA arts education ecosystem, as someone who knows firsthand what it was like. A main change that I decided to implement was the inclusion of a new graph entitled "County Breakdown" to better explain the point that I was trying to make concerning the automatic disadvantage that Title I schools face. This graph compares the concentration of percentage of Title I schools per county with the percentage of poverty rates, non-white residents, and higher education degrees obtained. This graphic was able to show that the counties with the lower amount of Title I schools overwhelmingly have a higher percentage of residents with higher education degrees, and a lower poverty rate compared to the other counties.
