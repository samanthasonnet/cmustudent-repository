# Outline
> This final project looks at the large disparities that exist with K-12 arts education in Pennsylvania, specifically focusing on the Southwestern region of Pennsylvania. I was inspired to focus my project on this topic due to my current involvement in a Systems Synthesis project for Carnegie Mellon University that is working with Arts Education Collaborative's initiative known as artlook SWPA, an online database that serves as a robust tool for artists, arts educators, and arts organizations. I found that after working on this project for the entire Fall semester, I have grown passionate about arts education in Pennsylvania, and was absolutely shocked to find out the disparities that exist between Title I/Non-Title I school resources, as well as Urban/Non-Urban arts organization resources. Overall, this portrayal will be tricky because I need to maintain the confidential information that was given to us by our client while still telling a meaningful, untold story... as there is plenty of valuable information to tell.

Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.
