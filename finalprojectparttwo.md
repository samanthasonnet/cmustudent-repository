![Initial Story Structure](one.jpeg)
> This image shows the flow of the structure of the story I am going to tell concerning equity in Southwestern PA arts education, specifically addressing the disparities in K-12 arts ed through a lack of accountability within PA Core Arts Standards. I will begin by presenting the reader with the current situation of Southwestern PA K-12 schools, Title 1/Non-Title 1, etc. and then move onto the disparities shown between arts resources in Allegheny (and other urban) counties compared to the other remaining counties of the 13 total. I will also discuss more about how the PA arts standards are overall lacking. Finally, I will end with a call-to-action concerning how to hold privileged organizations/schools/funders accountable and how to contact PA legislators to make things better.

# User research 

## Target audience
> My target audience is anyone who is personally affected by the K-12 arts education sector in Southwestern Pennsylvania, specifically students, educators, parents, artists, arts organizations, policy makers and educational advocates. I purposely interviewed one educator from a Southwestern PA Non-Title I School as well as one from a Title I School to get their perspectives on if I am telling the story in a relevant manner. 

## Interview script
> 1. What do you think the story is that I am trying to tell?
> 2. Who is the intended audience for this?
> 3. Does anything particularly surprise you?
> 4. As an educator (I plan to interview at least one educator from a Title I school and one from a Non-Title I school)/student alumni/parent of this educational system, do these statistics resonate with you and your personal experience?
> 5. Are you left with any questions after reading all of this?
