## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to create impactful data visualizations by leveraging my existing creative background as both a studio artist and a digital marketer while simulataneously enhancing my data reporting skills and knowledge. As a digital marketer, I feel that this class is imperative to build upon my portfolio of softwares used to make me stand out on a resume. I also hope to learn how to create these visualizations in a consise, yet detailed manner.
